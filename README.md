This program is a secure password vault that does not require any form of internet connection to run.

The initial registry screen prompts the user to enter a password that they will use to get into the vault.
Then, they will enter a screen that will give them a recovery key in case they forget their password.  The users
are advised to keep the recovery key somewhere safe.

From the main application page, the user can add accounts to the vault.  Each page shows 15 accounts, and there
are arrows that can shift to the next and previous page to navigate through accounts if the user has an abundance.

If the user chooses to reset their password, they will be directed to the reset page, in which it will prompt them
to enter their recovery code.  If the recovery code is correct, they will be redirected to the registry page and
will have to put in a new password.
